<description><![CDATA[  I am having a garage sale on this Saturday 4/23/2011 (from 10:30 am to 6:00 pm) in the parking lot behind my appartement complex on 2420 P st (apt 6) Sacramento Ca 95816...
<br> 

<br> 
 A lot of wonderfull stuff sold for moving price; you know what I mean... Most of the furniture and appliances is almost brand new as it was used only by my parents for 2 months before they traveled and then just got stored, waiting the lucky buyer..... Don't miss it
<br> 

<br> 
 I might also be able to sell earlier on Friday if you are really interested so you can reach me on 916 833 6928 Ramzi / Mike.
